                    <h2>Virtual Mouse</h2>
                    <p class="">After a successful year, we at IEEE Communications Society are back to what we do best. The Virtual Mouse Workshop, which happened as part of Gravitas ’18, was a phenomenal success.
The workshop witnessed participation from 60 enthusiastic students, who were buzzing with the keenness to learn the nuances of image processing & CNNs!
The workshop started with an introductory session about rudimentary image processing & moved on to the technicalities of image analysis. The participants coded in python to capture images from their webcams and perform analysis on them using various image processing algorithms. All the important topics ranging from image segmentation to all the filtering mechanisms were covered.
The most sought-after part of the workshop was, without a doubt, the interactive session that was conducted by Vicara. Vicara is one of the top startups emerging out of the VIT Technology Incubator, that has grabbed the attention of many tech enthusiasts & entrepreneurs alike, for their innovation & cutting edge cost-effective tool which uses gesture controls.

                    <p class="">Continuing our success streak, IEEE Communications Society has come up with another triumphant workshop – Machine Learning Workshop with a Self-Learning Robotic Arm. In association with Makxenia, the workshop was conducted in utmost fashion, covering all the theoretical algorithms & important Python coding exercises.
The workshop was kick started with an introduction to Machine Learning and all the different avenues where it’s applied. Further, the basic ideas of data science & ML algorithms were discussed. Later, the enthusiastic participants were exposed to the nuances of Python coding of different important algorithms such as kNN, Classification & Clustering.
The evening session was handled by the experienced professionals from Makxenia company. The participants assembled the robotic arm from scratch and learned a lot about the module while they were at it.</p>

So, as our first event in GraVITas we introduce Tech-o-write.This event allows you to spin a story around something technical. It doesn't have to come entirely from you, we will give you the base to build on. All you have to do is give your best.Even the worst thing you can write is better than the best thing you don't write.</p>
