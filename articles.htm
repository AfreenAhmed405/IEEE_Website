            To pass muster, AI would need to prove itself virtually foolproof. “What you don’t want to have is the system to fail in a very unusual way and say, ‘I give up, I’ll just transfer control back over to the human.’ And then a human won’t know how to recover,” Kochenderfer says.

            <br>
            As we all know that Autopilots on airliners fly through turbulence every day using ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. Researchers did not preprogram the code in the system with the aerodynamic model of the plane that would normally define how the autopilot should change thrust. Instead, researchers designed the software to rapidly figure out how to make the aircraft execute the appropriate pitch, roll and yaw maneuvers. This software was developed under a NASA aeronautics initiative called Learn-to-Fly. Before flying public will entrust their lives to completely automated aircraft in which artificial intelligence software that might utilize Learn-to-Fly code.  When some emergency situation occurs, to cope with them it plays out in  three dimensions -numerous flight control surfaces involved, a range of ambient conditions and data arriving from multiple sensors. This  AI software recognizes when sensor readings are incorrect. Then software would need to make the right decision in a situation          that might never have arisen before, and AI designers and flight regulators would need to be assured 
             that it would make the right decision.

            And one more interesting thing is that Joined Airlines has tied up with Amazon Alexa to enable clients to check in and find out about their flights. Can we think that this happens because of AL?

            "A Virtual Vision of the Real World"
            <br><br>
            Augmented reality is an interactive experience of real-world environment where the objects present in real world are enhanced by computer created virtual information. Augmented reality (AR) is a system that makes accurate 3D registration of real and virtual objects and real time interaction. It will place the information of the object over it as several layers. This information can be real or virtual. It has some multiple sensory modalities like visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory and other modalities. An Augogram is a computer-generated image used to create AR. Augography is making of augograms for AR. This experience will alter the perception of the environment. This will not just simply display the data about object but increase the sensation as it is a part of real world. 
            <br><br>
            Augmented reality experiences were first introduced into entertainment, gaming and business fields. Then these applications have been used in education, communication, medicine and construction fields. In education field this can be used as the content can be accessed by viewing scanning an image. In construction field can use the AR helmet that displays the information about construction sites.
            <br><br>
            By introducing AR cameras into smart phone AR technology will enrich the experience of the real world. Seeing other real sensed information such as electromagnetic radio waves with overlaid alignments where they are actually in space.    
            <br><br>
            Head mounted display (HMD) is used to display the image of both physical world and virtual objects in user field view. HMD is a transparent display that presents data without requiring users to look away from viewpoints. Techniques include speech recognition systems that can translate a user's spoken words into computer instructions, and gesture recognition systems that can interpret the body movements by visual detection or from sensors embedded in a peripheral device such as a wand, stylus, pointer, glove or other body wear.
            <br><br>
            This AR is used in public safety situations like emergency management, search and rescue. Also, facilitates social interaction and in military, teaching institutes.
            <br><br>
            Some of the example applications of AR are Snapchat, Google lens and some games are Pokemon Go, Zombies run.

            <center><h2>LI-FI TECHNOLOGY</h2></center>
            <br><br>
            <h5><b>AUTHOR:</b> Dhanunjaya P.</h5>
            <br>
            It is remarkable that LiFi replaces WiFi in upcoming days, LiFi (Light Fidelity) has internet speed with more than 100 times than WiFi. It has the capacity to transfer data about 225 Gbps that means you can download 18 movies with in 1 second. In WiFi data is transferred through radio waves but in LiFi data is transferred through light waves, WiFi speed get decreased when it is shared among various devices, but in LiFi it is not like that data is transferred in devices with same speed and you can induce as many as devices where you can get light,LiFi is secured than WiFi and it does’nt emit radiation which is harm to us, LiFi is cheaper source, we get signals of LiFi in form of light that means where there is a light availability there we will receive signals, This light is emitted through specific LED’s which acts as source. Receivers meant to receive LiFi signals are not implemented currently in the devices, but in upcoming days this could be easily induced in the devices. 
            <br><br>
            <center><img src="images/blog/lifi.png"></center>
            <br>
            The main disadvantage is you can’t use LiFi when there is no light that means for example you LED’s are kept in one room and you want to use it in another room where there is no penetration of LED light in that case you can’t avail LiFi and during day times sunlight may dominant over LED light, considering these issues scientists are working on this.
            <br><br>
            If we see the way of working of this LiFi, When an electrical current is applied to a LED light bulb a stream of light (photons) is emitted from the bulb. LED bulbs are semiconductor devices,which means that the brightness of the light flowing through them can be changed at extremely high speeds. This allows us to send a signal by modulating the light at different rates. The signal can then be received by a detector which interprets the changes in light intensity (the signal) as data.
            <br><br>
            It gives bandwidth with 1000 times more than WiFi. Since WiFi is not recommended to use in hospitals due to radiography, aeroplanes due to high altitude and destruction in signals in plane LiFi can be used at this places to access internet. Light bounces off of surfaces and therefore LiFi is not strictly a line-of-sight technology. LiFi is a cellular communication system and the data rate is not dependent on the line of sight but on the signal quality at the device. Signal quality can be defined by the ratio of the desired data vs any interfering data and noise. 
            <br><br>
            Today companies can speak to pure LiFi about working with us on proof of concept projects and other types of installations. These installations are priced based on individual requirements. There are also other options for using invisible parts of the light spectrum such as infra-red, which is currently already being used for sending information back to the light bulb (uplink) this infrared has penetrating power so that signals can be received through thin objects . No environmental factors can affect this LiFi since transfer of data is taken place through electromagnetic waves this can be used to communicate among Astronauts or Satellites.

                <center><h2>MICROCHIP MANUFACTURING</h2></center>
                <br><br>
                <h5><b>AUTHOR:</b> Dhanunjaya Burra</h5>
                <br>
                <center><img src="images/blog/microchip.jpg"></center>
                <br>
                Generally people compare the microchips as it determines the specifications and performance of the device (mobiles) such as, Samsung’s its own Exynos chipset as well as Qualcomm's Snapdragon. Most Used Chipsets: Samsung. The most popular chipset, the Exynos 8890, is used in the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, Apple Chipsets etc. These chips have various configurations to perform certain tasks, Kirin 970 a chipset has added artificial intelligence and NPU manufactured by Huawei. Intel has laid the platform in microchip manufacture; they became pioneers in manufacturing of micro chip, that’s why Intel inside exciting features outside.  
                <br><br>
                Whatever the electronic gadgets we use in our daily life the very fundamental and exciting thing is microchip, the heart of electronics. How we humans have brain to organise various functions in the same way micro chip is a device for computer, mobiles, TV’s......etc. In olden days a computer is placed in a huge room now it came to pocket size due to this micro chip. Coming to the definition, a microchip is a unit of packaged computer circuitry (usually called an integrated circuit) that is manufactured from a material such as silicon at a very small scale. Microchips are made for program logic (logic or microprocessor chips) and for computer memory (memory or RAM chips). The main part is transistor in microchip they like neurons of the gadget these can act as switch based on binary condition since computer know only binary language(0’s and 1’s) this acts as platform to link software and hardware. Transistor has the capacity to ON/OFF 1,000,00,00,00,000 /sec. Micro chip have billion’s of transistors. To link these transistors a simulation is used known as CAD (Computer Aided Design), if it works then it is taken further steps to manufacture known as fabrication.
                <br><br>
                Let’s have a look how this exciting powerful part is manufactured, It’s basic raw material is sand because it has silicon. In order to extract Silicon, sand is heated up to 2000 0C, silicon obtained in this process is purified up to 99.99%. This molten Silicon is converted into cylindrical shape known as ingot, later ingot is cut and polished in the form of thin discs, A thin layer of photo-resist coating is applied on the disc, now the desired design is placed on the disc and U.V light is sent on the disc photo-resist coating becomes disappear on the place where U.V light is exposed and the rest gives the impression of the design this process is known as Photolithography. Now it is coated with certain dielectric materials these layers can be only seen by microscope. To have connection among transistors very  thin copper wiring is placed around 30 layers, now this disc is cut into thin sub divisions like this we will get 1000 microchips per disc now a cap like structure is placed on the chip such that it protects from dust and other external means, a heat sink also embedded in the chip to prevent overheating. Now the glorious micro chip is ready. At first only 5 transistors are placed on micro chip today we see billions of transistors. We have studied the Moore’s law in Engineering Physics that transistors embed on microchip doubles every year.
                <br><br>
                Since these transistors are very sensitive we take lot of precautions while manufacturing, the main obstruction for making micro chips are dust particles present in air it could not be seen with eyes but make hell in manufacturing just like corona virus threat to humans, if a small dust particle is accumulated between the narrow connections among transistors they will get short circuited. To overcome this problem these are manufactured in clean room but the name suggests it doesn’t mean that room is cleaned every time here the air in the room is purified frequently; it is 1000 times cleaner than operation theatre in hospital. Those who go to clean room they must wear special suits called bunny suits that protect the chips from dead cells and hair of humans.

                <center><h2>MOBILE NETWORKS</h2></center>
                <br><br>
                <h5><b>AUTHOR:</b> [Author Name]</h5>
                <br>
                <strong>Did you ever think how your mobile works? No, I’m not talking about clicking photos,apps and games. Let me be clear, did you ever wonder how does a call go through, how a message is sent, how your SIM enables you to access the Internet? If your answer for any of the questions is a big NO, read below to find out. </strong>
                <br><br>
                Every MNO is first registered in a country and is granted a certain range of frequencies (spectrum). The MNOs buy the spectrum ranges from the government and operate.  In India there are 23 telecom circles. Eg: AP and TS, Delhi, North East etc. The MNOs set up base stations all over the country, which are areas of land, typically hexagonal, and have at least one cell tower. The cell towers are connected to each other, to hand off data in the form of packets of signals – data, voice and text messages.  The data is finally brought to the receiver mobile/computer. The MNOs use each others’ towers in many areas, so as to create a complex web that offers the widest possible network coverage area to subscribers. Networks offer two types of SIMs - GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) are two types of SIMs you get in the market. GSM is SIM protected i.e. you can change the SIM , if you want to change a network. CDMA is network protected. The SIM works in unison with the handset, and it’s not enough to change only the SIM if you want to change a network. You have to change the handset (mobile) too. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>The big question – HOW DO THE NETWORKS PROVIDE US INTERNET?</strong>
                <br><br>
                All the things you do on the Internet, involve sending and receiving data. The data is transmitted in the form of packets. The packets are sent over various servers, which are interlinked with each other. The servers in a country are linked with each other, and also with servers all over the world. So, everytime you use Google, you send packets of data to its server, and Google sends back the required data. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>So, how do they make money?</strong>
                <br><br>
                Once the MNOs get their licenses from the government, they manufacture SIM cards, which people buy. Every time you make a call, or send a message, the data is transmitted over their licensed spectrums. They may be local call (within the circle) or long distance calls. The money you pay to get your SIM recharged is the money you’re paying to transmit your data over the carrier’s network.  The data you use, the videos you watch on YouTube, are all delivered using various networks’ services. This way, the MNOs charge you for using their servers and spectrum for sending data and getting data. Some mobile networks also rent out spaces on their towers to their competitors, which gives them a new stream of revenue. They also get paid by some websites/ OTT platforms for allowing their subscribers to access their content.

                Social credit system is a disciplinary program that involves every citizen in the nation. It is monitoring every human being through surveillance cameras by using image processing. And giving a score to everyone based on their activity in the society.
                <br><br>
                Those who will do good things which are useful for society will get a good score. For those who perform unusual activities that cause harm to the environment and society, their score will be deducted. For example, a person spits on the footpath he will be identified by the AI-based camera and his score will be deducted.
                <br><br>
                Image processing and AI plays major role in this social credit system.

                China is the first country to use this social credit system. This was under trials in 2009 and tested in 2015 and it is about to implement national wide by 2020. This is under the control of the people’s bank of china.
                <br><br>
                China’s Social Credit System is a system that collects information about Chinese citizens from various sources, weighs the various data, and generates a ranking for each citizen.
                <br><br>
                Once implemented the system will manage the rewards, or punishments, of citizens based on their economic and personal behavior.

                <strong>Benefits with high credit score:</strong>
                <br>
                The rewards of having a high score include easier access to loans and jobs and priority during bureaucratic paperwork. 
                <br><br>
                <strong>Consequences with low credit score:</strong>
                <br>
                the immediate negative consequences for a low score, or being associated to someone with a low score, range from lower internet speeds to being denied access to certain jobs, loans and visas, flight ban, exclusion from private schools, exclusion from high prestige work, exclusion from hotels, and registration on a public blacklist.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Advantages:</strong>
                <br>
                1) controlling the people<br>
                2) Personal security<br>
                3) Economic morality<br>
                4) Execution through rewards
                <br><br>
                <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                <br>
                Lack of freedom is the biggest disadvantage.

                <center><h2>WIRELESS CHARGING OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES</h2></center>
                <br><br>

                <strong>The world is going wireless. The Internet has become wireless, our phones became wireless, phone charging became wireless. So, why not electric vehicles charging become wireless.</strong>
                <br><br>
                We assume electric cars have to be plugged in---its right in the name of the “plug-in” hybrid, after all— but if it weren’t for plugs and cables, EVs might face a brighter future, sooner. Here’s how wireless charging makes it happen.
                <br><br>
                Charging cars without wires works in a similar way to the wireless phone charger you might already own, just on a bigger scale. You might have noticed how you can lift your phone very slightly off its charger without stopping the flow of electricity - wireless car chargers work in the same way, but in a distance measured in inches instead of millimeters. Using a technology called inductive charging, electricity is transferred through an air gap from one magnetic coil in the charger to a second magnetic coil fitted to the car. All you have to do is park in the right place so the coils are aligned, and charging will begin.
                <br><br>

                Charging while driving is the holy grail of electric car technology; the ability to power a car as it drives over chargers embedded into the surface of the road. 
                <br><br>
                As part of its development of the Halo system (working with wireless electric vehicle charging ), Qualcomm has already proved that charging while driving is possible, even while the vehicle is traveling at up to 70mph. The technology is called Dynamic Electric Vehicle Charging. Underneath the regular-looking road surface of its 100-meter test track, Qualcomm has installed a wireless charging system which sends power to a fleet of specially modified Renault Kangoo electric vans, each fitted with two 10kW charging pads.
                <br><br>
                After carefully analysing we can say that this technology has got a future opportunity based on the recent trend of the automotive industry moving towards autonomous cars with user comfort & safety as the top priority.In order to get this technology appreciated by the mass market, it has to overcome the cost and efficiency issues which needed further research and technology development.

                <center><h2>SATELLITE PHONES</h2></center>
                <br><br>

                <strong>If you’re a fan of military- action movies or political dramas, you might’ve heard about something called “sat phone”. Here’s an article about Sat Phones, to help you understand how they work in real life</strong>
                <br><br>
                A satellite phone, popularly known as the sat phone, is a mobile phone which uses satellites, not landline or cellular broadcasting towers, to make or receive calls. It works through the help of three satellite networks 
                <br><br>
                The three main satellite networks are the Iridium, Globstar and Thuraya. Iridium uses low orbiting satellites that minimises conversational delays, but more importantly, it is the only satellite network that provides coverage across the world, including the oceans.
                <br><br>
                <center><img src="images/blog/satphone1.jpg"></center>
                <br>
                Globstar covers around 80 per cent of the earth's landmasses, excluding the northern and southern polar regions.
                <br><br>
                Thuraya covers parts of India, Asia, Africa, the entire Middle East and Europe. Sat phones are specifically manufactured for a particular network and do not work on other networks
                <br><br>
                While making or receiving a call, the signal first travels to the orbiting satellite and then to an earth-bound gateway, before being routed to the receiver. The receiver's response will follow the same path in reverse, taking an equal amount of time to reach the caller.
                <br><br>
                The mobile equipment, which is also known as a terminal, varies in size. The instrument, which is fitted with retraceable antennae, is not as sleek as a mobile phone. A satellite phone resembles the models of mobile phones that were available in Indian markets ten years ago.
                <br><br>
                <strong>How much do they cost?</strong>
                <br><br>
                The oldest models cost approximately Rs 10,000 while the latest model, the iconic Iridium 9505A, costs a whopping Rs 49,975.Some companies offer sat phones on rent, and the weekly rent is approximately $24 (Rs 1,200 approximately). The cost of making calls from a satellite phone varies between Rs 7 and Rs 99 per minute. However, calling a sat phone from a land phone or a mobile phone is extremely expensive and charges range from Rs 149 to Rs 699 per minute. The sat phone also offers messaging service and the rates are approximately $0.59 (Rs 25) per message.
